    Imagine building a LEGO house! Scaffolding in design is like having a basic LEGO frame ready. You can choose the frame and then add your own colors, rooms, and decorations to make it your own special dream house! So the ability of customizations are the power of scaffolds.

## What is Software Scaffold

Ever heard of traditional software templates? They're like pre-made blueprints for websites, APIs, or even Docker containers. But let's be honest, traditional templates often leave you feeling lost:

- Lack of resources, customizations
- Not clear about the tech they use in that template, making modifications a challenge.
- Not have clear documentations on how to adapt and how to work with that template
- No clue how to launch/deploy your creation and make it accessible to the world.
